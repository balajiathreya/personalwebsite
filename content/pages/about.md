<img src='../images/me.jpg'/ align='left' style='width:204px; margin-right:25px;''> I'm a 28 year old guy living in the bay area who likes to drink copious amounts of coffee, learn programming and build software. On my freetime, I like to [read books](https://www.goodreads.com/balajiathreya), ride my bike, run, watch netflix and sleep. I graduated from Oregon State University with a Masters degree in Computer Science in Fall 2013. At OSU, I worked with [Dr. Christopher Scaffidi](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~cscaffid/)

I currently work at eBay as a [Software Engineer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/balajiathreya). I'm a big fan of [Xubuntu - the XFCE based linux distro](http://xubuntu.org/) and I use it on my personal laptop.
